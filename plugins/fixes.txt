;; SQL ESCAPING

;; By default, sql-mode does not recognize \' as an escape for the
;; single quote character, which can lead to a very crappy color
;; highlighting. To fix everything, go to the sql.el file (in
;; lisp-install-dir/progmodes) and comment out this line :
;; (modify-syntax-entry ?\ “.” table)
;; then type “M-x byte-compile-file” to compile and restart emacs.
